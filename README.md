Gamers-Community-Code-of-Conduct-2014-draft
===========================================
fellow gamers, if we wish to achieve a tangible goal once the Gamers Revolution of 2014 has come to an end, 
then we must make preparations for after the war, and compile a clear set of demands, these should include
an official treaty that defines a Community Code of Conduct, and a Seal of Approval by the community with 
which we can reward and distinguish those who abide by worthy conduct.
